                                        JavaScript is most commonly used as a client side scripting language. 
                                        This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. 
                                        When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it. 
                                </p>

                                        <li class="AddColorToMoreTextInsideBigBox">To declare a variable in JavaScript, we must use the keyword var followed by the name of the variable and semi-colon. 
                                            Below is the syntax to create variables in JavaScript: var var_name;
                                             The var_name is the name of the variable which should be defined by the user and should be unique.</li>
                                        
                                            <li class="bullet">Variable Types. All variables in the Java language must have a data type. A variable's type determines the values that the variable can have and the operations that can be performed on it. ... Primitive types contain a single value and include types such as integer, floating point, character, and boolean.  </li>
